# Instacart-Basket-Analysis-Program
By using Python, I performed data wrangling and analysis of several datasets for Instacart. Then, I created reports that communicate my analysis process as well as my results and recommendations. 

## Objective

Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app, wants to find out more about its sales habits. Their stakeholders put significant importance on understanding different customer profiles to successfully modify promotions and offerings. This data will help Instacart to improve its approach, providing a better shopping experience while boosting business development.

## Key Questions

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.

● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:

1 What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?

2 Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?

3 Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

4 Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?

5 What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

6 What differences can you find in the ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of

## Data

● Orders

● Products

● Order_Products-Prior

● Departments

● Customers

(Data files do not upload because of GitHub size, and Instacart is a real company that has made its data accessible online. However, the data sets provided in this project brief were created specifically for this project and given by Career Foundry.) 

## Tools

The following Python libraries were used for the data analyzed for this project:
Pandas: for data analization
Numpy: for mathematical equations
SciPy: for mathematical equations
Seaborn: for data visualization
Matplotlib: for data visualization

## Folders

 The project files are divided between the following folders:
 
● Project Management: Project Brief 

● Data: (Data divided into two subfolders Original data and Prepared data, and data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size.) 

● Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.

● Analysis: Reports and Visualizations are separated into two subfolders. Crosstabs may be found in the Reports subdirectory, the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.

● Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel

## Resources

Note: Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of this project brief
have been fabricated for this Achievement.
